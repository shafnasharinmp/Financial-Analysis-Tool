# Financial Analysis Tool Leveraging Time Series Analysis and Natural Language Processing Techniques (LLM)
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive financial analysis tool that integrates time series analysis with natural language processing (NLP) techniques, utilizing the advantages of  Large Language Models (LLMs). The tool will be built in Python and will include a user-friendly frontend interface, potentially using Streamlit or a suitable alternative. The project aims to address the challenges in financial analysis, such as accuracy, scalability, and interpretability, by leveraging time series analysis and natural language processing techniques. These challenges include selecting the right forecasting model, handling large volumes of data, and integrating complex models into existing systems.
